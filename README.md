# parse-and-sort



## Usage
Run via command line with:
      
      $ lein run file.txt

Run test cases with:

    $ lein test

From jar file:

    $ java -jar parse-and-sort-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]


## Assumptions
The formatting of the input text includes the following:  
      
      *headers included (like a csv file). 
      *properly formatted input in this order (LastName FirstName Gender FavoriteColor DateOfBirth). 
      *\n at end of line. 

I am outputting all three outputs to the command line

Post input is a single line formatted like this: “LastName FirstName Gender FavoriteColor DateOfBirth”

GET routes return same data as each respective console output
